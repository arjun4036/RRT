# RRT

This Python script generates a visualization of the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm using Pygame. The RRT algorithm is a popular path planning algorithm used in robotics to find a feasible path from a start point to a goal point while avoiding obstacles.

**Requirements**

Python 3.x
Pygame library
Ubuntu 20

**Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**
   
$ git clone https://github.com/username/project.git

2.**Navigate to the project directory:**

$ cd project

3.**Install Pygame library:**

$ pip install pygame

**Usage**

1. **Run the Python script:**

$ python rrt_visualization.py

2.Follow the prompts to input the start and goal coordinates, as well as the number and positions of obstacles.
3.Once the visualization window opens, it will display the RRT algorithm's progress, including the tree expansion, obstacles, start and goal nodes, and the final path.
4.Close the visualization window to exit the program.

**Customization**

We can custom the visualization window by modifying the Width_Screen, Height_Screen and also the size of the obstacles can also be modified by changing Obstacle_Min_Size, and Obstacle_Max_Size.

**Contributing**
